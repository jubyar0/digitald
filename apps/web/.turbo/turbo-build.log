You are importing your Prisma Client from the wrong path, please follow these steps:


1. At the root of this project (or package), get the relative path to your client.
For example, that could be `../prisma/client` or `./client` or something similar.


2. Once you know where your client is located, add your own client as a dependency.
 - For npm, run `npm add db@./path/to/your/client`
 - For pnpm, run `pnpm add db@link:./path/to/your/client`
 - For yarn, run `yarn add db@link:./path/to/your/client`


3. If you have a `tsconfig.json`, you will need to set `module` and `moduleResolution`.
Set `moduleResolution` to `nodenext` or `bundler`, and set `module` to `nodenext`.



4. Update your imports, once done, your client will be properly set up.
```
import { PrismaClient } from "db"
```

(node:10028) Warning: SECURITY WARNING: The SSL modes 'prefer', 'require', and 'verify-ca' are treated as aliases for 'verify-full'.
In the next major version (pg-connection-string v3.0.0 and pg v9.0.0), these modes will adopt standard libpq semantics, which have weaker security guarantees.

To prepare for this change:
- If you want the current behavior, explicitly use 'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq compatibility now, use 'uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require'

See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for libpq SSL mode definitions.

Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with "use server". Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it.

   Generating static pages (144/193) 
(node:23064) Warning: SECURITY WARNING: The SSL modes 'prefer', 'require', and 'verify-ca' are treated as aliases for 'verify-full'.
In the next major version (pg-connection-string v3.0.0 and pg v9.0.0), these modes will adopt standard libpq semantics, which have weaker security guarantees.

To prepare for this change:
- If you want the current behavior, explicitly use 'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq compatibility now, use 'uselibpqcompat=true&sslmode=require'

See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html for libpq SSL mode definitions.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
