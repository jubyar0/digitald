console.warn('You are importing your Prisma Client from the wrong path, please follow these steps:\n\n\n1. At the root of this project (or package), get the relative path to your client.\nFor example, that could be `../prisma/client` or `./client` or something similar.\n\n\n2. Once you know where your client is located, add your own client as a dependency.\n - For npm, run `npm add db@./path/to/your/client`\n - For pnpm, run `pnpm add db@link:./path/to/your/client`\n - For yarn, run `yarn add db@link:./path/to/your/client`\n\n\n3. If you have a `tsconfig.json`, you will need to set `module` and `moduleResolution`.\nSet `moduleResolution` to `nodenext` or `bundler`, and set `module` to `nodenext`.\n\n\n\n4. Update your imports, once done, your client will be properly set up.\n```\nimport { PrismaClient } from "db"\n```\n\n\nMore information: https://pris.ly/d/custom-output')
